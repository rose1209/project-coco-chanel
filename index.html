		<h2>Early life</h2>
		<p>Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in 1883 to Eugénie Jeanne Devolle—known as Jeanne—a laundrywoman, in the charity hospital run by the Sisters of Providence (a poorhouse) in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, France.[7]:14[8] She was Jeanne's second child with Albert Chanel; the first, Julia, was born less than a year earlier.</p>

		<h2>Last years
</h2>
		<p>According to Edmonde Charles-Roux,[9]:222 Chanel had become tyrannical and extremely lonely late in life. In her last years she was sometimes accompanied by Jacques Chazot and her confidante Lilou Marquand. A faithful friend was also the Brazilian Aimée de Heeren, who lived in Paris four months a year at the nearby Hôtel Meurice. </p>

		<h2>Death</h2>
		<p>As 1971 began, Chanel was 87 years old, tired, and ailing. She carried out her usual routine of preparing the spring catalogue. She had gone for a long drive the afternoon of Saturday, 9 January. Soon after, feeling ill, she went to bed early.[19]:196 She died on Sunday, 10 January 1971, at the Hotel Ritz, where she had resided for more than 30 years</p>
